Neural network and graphical front end for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST data set.

Many thanks to:

1. Michael Neilsen's excellent book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) which I used as a technical reference for developing the network.
2. Jeff Griffith for the reader (https://github.com/jeffgriffith/mnist-reader)
